## Artifacts

- **xhs-tool** — Frontend React app (path: `/`, port from PORT env)
- **api-server** — Express API backend (path: `/api`, port 8080)

## Authentication

- Uses Clerk (Replit-managed) with email/password and Google login
- Frontend: `@clerk/react` with `ClerkProvider` in App.tsx
- Backend: `@clerk/express` middleware in app.ts with proxy middleware
- Landing page at `/` for unauthenticated users
- Sign-in at `/sign-in`, sign-up at `/sign-up`
- All app routes protected — redirect to `/` if not signed in
- After sign-in, redirects to `/dashboard`
- User profile + logout button in sidebar footer

## File Upload

- Object storage provisioned via Replit (GCS-backed)
- Server routes: `POST /api/storage/uploads/request-url`, `GET /api/storage/objects/*`, `GET /api/storage/public-objects/*`
- Client: `@workspace/object-storage-web` lib with `ObjectUploader` component (Uppy v5)
- Two-step flow: request presigned URL → upload directly to GCS
- Used in Assets page and Content Editor for image uploads

## AI Image Generation

- `POST /api/ai/generate-image` — generates images via gpt-image-1
- `POST /api/ai/edit-image` — reference-based image generation (伪原创配图) via gpt-image-1 images.edit
  - Accepts prompt + referenceImageUrl (storage URL of uploaded competitor/viral image)
  - Fetches reference image, passes to openai.images.edit to create similar-style originals
- Accepts prompt, style (optional), size (1024x1024, 1024x1536, 1536x1024, auto)
- Default size: 1024x1536 (portrait, optimized for XHS phone display)
- Returns b64_json, auto-uploads to object storage
- Integrated in content editor and workflow wizard with Chinese prompt support

## Workflow Wizard

- Guided 3-step flow at `/workflow`: 灵感研究 → 创作内容 → 发布
- Step 1 (内容策略): Region selector with 3 region buttons (🇸🇬 SG, 🇭🇰 HK, 🇲🇾 MY), then AI Content Strategy Analysis — input business description/link/niche → AI analyzes industry content strategies → generates 3 original content plans with posting time recommendations → user picks one
- Step 2 (生成内容): Combined content creation + preview — AI-assisted editor (rewrite, title/hashtag/image generation, image/video upload) with live preview card, content stats, and sensitivity check in right sidebar. Streamlined AI image panel: auto-detects reference mode when competitor image is uploaded, otherwise generates from text prompt. When adopting a strategy suggestion, AI progress animation overlay auto-fills content, runs sensitivity check with auto-fix (rewrites flagged content automatically), AND auto-generates a cover image — delivering a complete content package ready for review.
- Step 3 (发布): AI-recommended posting times display, image/video download gallery with per-image download buttons and "download all" option, auto-copy content → open XHS Creator Studio → mark as published → success with "publish next" option
- Dashboard has prominent gradient CTA card linking to workflow
- Sidebar has highlighted "创建发布" nav item

## AI Guide / Assistant

- Floating chat widget on all authenticated pages (bottom-right corner)
- `POST /api/ai/guide` — step-aware XHS operations assistant (gpt-4o-mini)
- Sends current workflow step number + account region to backend for precise context
- Different quick prompts per page (dashboard, workflow, content, accounts)
- Proactive tips when entering workflow, encourages and guides users through each step
- Specialized in XHS platform rules, content strategy, algorithm tips
- Minimizable/closable, persists conversation during session

## Credits System
